Hi! I’m Efe, a second-year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://ml.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by [Barnabás Póczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) and [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). I'm broadly interested in reinforcement learning, uncertainty, exploration, and AI for scientific discovery.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Bilkent University, Turkey, in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I worked with [Cem Tekin](https://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cemtekin/) and [Çağın Ararat](https://sites.google.com/view/cararat/about) on bandits and optimization at the [CYBORG Lab](https://cyborg.bilkent.edu.tr/).

Apart from research, I'm a drummer (to varying degrees of success) and a big enjoyer of music—mostly classic rock, heavy metal, jazz fusion and progressive rock. I also like to read and think about philosophy, especially philosophy of mind.
